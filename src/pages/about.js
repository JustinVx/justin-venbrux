        How to create a needy robot? This is a question you may have never asked yourself, but I have! Together with a group of five others I built three prototypes and we improved the interaction on every iteration. I worked as one of the two engineers of the group, where I worked on building an programming the actual robots. I also worked a lot on perfecting the interaction. This project involved an Arduino, laser cutting, sewing, electronics, a lot of testing and cuteness.
