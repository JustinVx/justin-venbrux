An overview of research into behavior change theory that I did while writing the thesis for my MSc.

## Classical conditioning
One of the basic building blocks of behavior change theory is classical conditioning.[^1] Classical conditioning is best explained through a famous experiment by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. In the experiment he used three things: dogs, a bell and dog food. Every time he gave food to the dogs, he rang the bell five second before. After a while, the dogs began to salivate when they heard the bell, even if no food was coming. The insight here is that you can elicit a response from a stimulus by associating it with another stimulus.

## Operant conditioning
The younger (but bigger) brother of classical conditioning is operant conditioning.[^2] Operant conditioning is a process where a behavior is followed by either a reward or a punishment. A reward will make it more likely for a behavior to be repeated, while a punishment makes it less likely for a behavior to repeated.

## Social cognitive theory
You can also help someone to learn a behavior by seeing it reinforced on someone else. Albert Bandura demonstrated this in his Bobo doll experiment.[^3] For this experiment he made a film that showed an adult model beating up a Bobo doll and shouting aggressively. The film was then shown to a group of children. Afterwards, those children and another group of children that had not seen the film, were allowed to play in a room that held a Bobo doll. The children that had seen the film were more likely to beat the doll and to imitate the adult in the film clip.

Bandura claims you are most likely to learn when you have a good deal of self-efficacy[^4] and you closely identify with the observed person. 



## Self-reinforcing loops
Thoughts, feelings and behavior all influence each other. It can happen that the resulting feelings and thoughts of a behavior work as a reinforcement of the behavior itself. This causes a snowball effect; a vicious circle. The behavior keeps growing and growing and growing.

Cognitive behavior therapy is based on the idea that one element of this vicious circle are the irrational automatic thoughts caused by emotions.[^5] If you address these thoughts and replace them with more rational thoughts, a negative loop of behavior can be stopped.

## Self-determination theory
Motivation is that what makes a person want to perform a behavior. According to the psychologists Richard Ryan and Edward Deci there are two types of motivation: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation.[^6]

Extrinsic motivation is motivation that leads to a specific outcome (a reward). But people also engage in behavior where no reinforcement or reward is expected: intrinsic behavior. This is caused by innate psychological needs and Ryan and Deci identified three of those: the need for competence, the need for relatedness and the need for autonomy. They also found that external rewards can have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation.

## Psychological reactance
When a person feels that someone or something is limiting their choices (their autonomy) a negative reaction occurs. This is what Jack Brehms claims in his theory of psychological reactance.[^7] The more important a free behavior is to a certain individual and the greater the threat against it is, the greater the magnitude of reactance will be.

## Habits
Neuroscientist Anthony Dickinson conducted a series of experiments with rats and found that if you go through an extensive period of operant conditioning you can make behavior into a habit.[^8] He found that a rat that had spent a lot of time training would press a button (habitual behavior), whereas a rat that had spent little time training the behavior would not (goal-directed behavior).

According to author and behavior designer Nir Eyal, habitual behavior (habits) can be created by making behavior occur as much as possible through triggers that are quickly successful, rewards that are variable and by accumulating investment such as time and data.


## Flow
A positive psychologists with the magnificent name Mihály Csikszentmihalyi, coined the term flow. Flow is a special form of goal-directed behavior. It is a mental state where a person is fully immersed in performing an activity, resulting in a loss of sense of time and space, while maintaining a clear goal and retaining full sense of control.[^9] You are most likely to get in a state of flow, when the amount of skill required for your goal is in good balance. Meaning it is not too easy as to cause boredom, neither is it too hard as to cause anxiety or frustration.

## Fogg Behavior Model
Behavior scientist BJ Fogg created the Fogg Behavior Model. According to this model you need motivation, ability and a trigger in order to succeed at behavior change.[^10] Dependent on the amount of motivation that is available and how much ability is required.

## Prospect theory
Prospect theory claims that people use simple, efficient rules — coined heuristics — to form judgements and make many of their decisions. These heuristics work well in most cases, but can lead to systematic deviations from logic called cognitive biases.[^11] People make decisions that are predictably irrational. 


## Narrative transportation
Social psychologist Melanie Green and John Donahue defined the concept of narrative transportation.[^12] This is a form of immersive, imaginative engagement in a story where you are so caught up in it, that the real world fades away. When people are fully engaged in a story they let some of the defenses down they normally have; they will learn from the experiences of characters and and are more likely to change their beliefs because of this.

## The self
Another way to change someone’s behavior is by altering their personal narrative or their *self*. We tell and create stories, to teach ourselves what we know and what we think. A personal narrative process is involved in a person’s sense of personal and cultural identity and in creating memories. By changing the story we tell about ourselves we can also change our behavior.[^13]

## Transfer effect
Games are designed to fulfill intrinsic needs. Because of
this they typically create an immersive and satisfying experience. This can also be used to create behavior change in the real world, by something called a transfer effect. It is the effect of an experienced game world on the forming, altering, or reinforcing of compliance, behavior or attitude of the user in the real world.[^14] This effect can be achieved through a game world specifically designed to motivate towards this transfer effect.
